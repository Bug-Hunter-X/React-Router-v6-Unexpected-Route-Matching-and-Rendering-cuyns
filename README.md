This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in React Router v6 related to route matching and rendering.  The issue arises when defining routes with paths that might unintentionally overlap or conflict, leading to unexpected behavior where components render incorrectly or not at all.

The `App.js` file contains the buggy code. The `AppSolution.js` file provides a solution and demonstrates how to address the issue by carefully defining routes and potentially utilizing more specific path matching techniques or route parameters.

The problem often involves a route unintentionally matching a more general route, preventing other components from correctly rendering.
